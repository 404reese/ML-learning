    "# Preprocessing Data for Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Importance of Preprocessing\n",
    "- Real-world data is rarely ready for machine learning.\n",
    "- scikit-learn requires input features to be numeric and without missing values.\n",
    "- Preprocessing transforms raw data into a usable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Handling Categorical Features\n",
    "- Categorical features (e.g., \"genre\", \"color\") must be converted to numeric form.\n",
    "- This is typically done using **dummy variables** (also known as one-hot encoding).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Dummy Variables Explained\n",
    "- For a categorical feature with `n` unique values, create `n` binary columns.\n",
    "- Each column represents a category: 1 if the observation belongs to it, otherwise 0.\n",
    "- To avoid redundancy (collinearity), drop one category (e.g., the last one).\n",
    "  - This is known as the **dummy variable trap**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Creating Dummy Variables in Python\n",
    "- Use either:\n",
    "  - `pandas.get_dummies()` (simpler and integrated into pandas)\n",
    "  - `sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder()` (more customizable)\n",
    "- Example with pandas:\n",
    "\n",
    "  import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "  df = pd.read_csv('music.csv')\n",
    "  dummies = pd.get_dummies(df['genre'], drop_first=True)\n",
    "  df = pd.concat([df, dummies], axis=1)\n",
    "  df = df.drop('genre', axis=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Alternatively, if only one categorical column exists:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  df = pd.get_dummies(df, drop_first=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Use Case: Music Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dataset includes a `genre` column with 10 categories.\n",
    "* Convert `genre` to 9 binary features using `get_dummies(drop_first=True)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Linear Regression with Dummies\n",
    "\n",
    "* After encoding, modeling steps remain the same.\n",
    "* Example: Linear regression to predict song popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Split data into training/test sets.\n",
    "  * Use `KFold` for cross-validation.\n",
    "  * Use `cross_val_score()` with `scoring='neg_mean_squared_error'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, KFold\n",
