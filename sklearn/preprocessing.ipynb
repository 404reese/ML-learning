    "# Preprocessing Data for Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Importance of Preprocessing\n",
    "- Real-world data is rarely ready for machine learning.\n",
    "- scikit-learn requires input features to be numeric and without missing values.\n",
    "- Preprocessing transforms raw data into a usable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Handling Categorical Features\n",
    "- Categorical features (e.g., \"genre\", \"color\") must be converted to numeric form.\n",
    "- This is typically done using **dummy variables** (also known as one-hot encoding).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Dummy Variables Explained\n",
    "- For a categorical feature with `n` unique values, create `n` binary columns.\n",
    "- Each column represents a category: 1 if the observation belongs to it, otherwise 0.\n",
    "- To avoid redundancy (collinearity), drop one category (e.g., the last one).\n",
    "  - This is known as the **dummy variable trap**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Creating Dummy Variables in Python\n",
    "- Use either:\n",
    "  - `pandas.get_dummies()` (simpler and integrated into pandas)\n",
    "  - `sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder()` (more customizable)\n",
    "- Example with pandas:\n",
    "\n",
    "  import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "  df = pd.read_csv('music.csv')\n",
    "  dummies = pd.get_dummies(df['genre'], drop_first=True)\n",
    "  df = pd.concat([df, dummies], axis=1)\n",
    "  df = df.drop('genre', axis=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Alternatively, if only one categorical column exists:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  df = pd.get_dummies(df, drop_first=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Use Case: Music Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dataset includes a `genre` column with 10 categories.\n",
    "* Convert `genre` to 9 binary features using `get_dummies(drop_first=True)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Linear Regression with Dummies\n",
    "\n",
    "* After encoding, modeling steps remain the same.\n",
    "* Example: Linear regression to predict song popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Split data into training/test sets.\n",
    "  * Use `KFold` for cross-validation.\n",
    "  * Use `cross_val_score()` with `scoring='neg_mean_squared_error'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, KFold\n",
    "  from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n",
    "  import numpy as np\n",

    "## 1. Centering and Scaling\n",
    "- Data imputation is an essential preprocessing step.\n",
    "- Centering and scaling are also critical for preparing data for machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Why Scale Our Data?\n",
    "- Features in datasets can have very different ranges:\n",
    "  - `duration_ms`: 0 to 1.62 million\n",
    "  - `speechiness`: decimal values\n",
    "  - `loudness`: negative values\n",
    "- Models using distance (e.g., KNN) can be biased by features with larger scales.\n",
    "- Scaling ensures all features contribute equally to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Scaling Techniques\n",
    "- **Standardization**:\n",
    "  - Subtract the mean, divide by the standard deviation.\n",
    "  - Resulting data has a mean of 0 and a variance of 1.\n",
    "- **Normalization**:\n",
    "  - Subtract the minimum, divide by the range.\n",
    "  - Transforms data to range between 0 and 1.\n",
    "- **Centering to [-1, 1]** is another option.\n",
    "- In this video, **standardization** is demonstrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Scaling with scikit-learn\n",
    "- Use `StandardScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing`.\n",
    "- Steps:\n",
    "  1. Split data before scaling to prevent data leakage.\n",
    "  2. Instantiate `StandardScaler`.\n",
    "  3. Use `fit_transform()` on training features.\n",
    "  4. Use `transform()` on test features.\n",
    "  5. Verify transformation by checking means and std deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Scaling in a Pipeline\n",
    "- Scalers can be included in pipelines with models.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  - Pipeline with `StandardScaler` + `KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=6)`\n",
    "  - Train-test split → Fit pipeline → Predict → Accuracy = 0.81\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "- We've now covered the full supervised learning workflow.\n",
    "- Next step: deciding which model to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Different Models for Different Problems\n",
    "- Choice depends on:\n",
    "  - **Dataset size**: Smaller datasets often favor simpler models.\n",
    "  - **Feature count**: Fewer features = simpler models, faster training.\n",
    "  - **Data-hungry models**: e.g., Artificial Neural Networks need large datasets.\n",
    "  - **Interpretability**: Linear models (e.g., Linear Regression) are easier to explain.\n",
    "  - **Flexibility/Accuracy**: More flexible models (e.g., KNN) can yield better predictions by making fewer assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "- scikit-learn provides a consistent API across models.\n",
    "- **Regression models**:\n",
    "  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n",
    "  - R-squared (R²)\n",
    "- **Classification models**:\n",
    "  - Accuracy\n",
    "  - Confusion Matrix & associated metrics\n",
    "  - ROC AUC\n",
    "- Evaluate several models using the same metric before hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Scaling Considerations\n",
    "- Some models are sensitive to feature scales:\n",
    "  - KNN, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression\n",
    "- Always scale data before model evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Model Evaluation Example\n",
    "- Task: Binary classification of song genre.\n",
    "- Models used:\n",
    "  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n",
    "  - Logistic Regression\n",
    "  - Decision Tree Classifier\n",
    "- Steps:\n",
    "  1. Import models\n",
    "  2. Create feature and target arrays\n",
    "  3. Split data into training and test sets\n",
    "  4. Scale features using `fit_transform()` and `transform()`\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Cross-Validation\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of model instances.\n",
    "- Initialize an empty list to store cross-validation results.\n",
    "- Loop through each model:\n",
    "  1. Instantiate `KFold`\n",
    "  2. Perform cross-validation using `cross_val_score` (scoring defaults to accuracy)\n",
    "  3. Append results to list\n",
    "- Visualize results using a boxplot with model names as labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Visualizing Results\n",
    "- Boxplot shows accuracy ranges from cross-validation.\n",
    "- Median accuracy shown with an orange line.\n",
    "- Logistic Regression has the best median score.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Evaluating on the Test Set\n",
    "- Loop through model dictionary using `.items()`.\n",
    "- Fit each model to the training set, evaluate on test set.\n",
    "- Logistic Regression achieves the highest test accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Practice\n",
    "- Time to choose and optimize models for your own supervised learning problems!\n"
